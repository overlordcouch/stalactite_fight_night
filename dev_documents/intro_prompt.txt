You, seeking adventure, have traveled far in search of the mythical 
Caverns of Neverending Despair and Depth.  Legends speak of heroic 
conquerers, devious villains, and monstrous behemoths testing their
mettle in the darkness of these caverns.  Some emerged victorious, while
most were never heard from again.

After weeks, nay years, of traveling and searching, you approach the 
ominous, gaping maw of a musty cavern.  The entrance is littered with 
bones and the air is heavy with the acrid stink of fear.  A little bit
of pee escapes your bladder as the cave seems to exhale a wind saturated
with the fetid stench of death.

It is only then that you notice an old woman sitting on a rock not far
from the entrance.  She beckons you closer.

"Are these the Caverns of Neverending Despair and Depth?" you ask,
with only the slightest quaver to your voice.

"Of course they are!", she exclaims.  "Do you intend to enter?"

You nod.

"Well then, traveler, what name do you go by?"
