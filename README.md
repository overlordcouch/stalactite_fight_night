# Stalactite Fight Night  
  
GAMEPLAY:
In Stalactite Fight Night, you play a thrill-seeking adventurer
attempting to plumb the depths of the Caves of Neverending Despair
and Depth.  Armed with your bare hands and your trusty bathrobe, you
set off to prove your bravery in the caves!

You enter the caves and are provided with a description of your
surroundings.  You may encounter aggressive monsters that you need
to defend yourself against.  On the other hand, you may encounter 
hidden treasure chests containing a variety of helpful trash and loot.
Search caves to find less obvious loot!  Don't be discouraged if you
don't find anything.  Each time you search, you get a little better at
finding hidden loot!

If you are overcome by monsters while exploring the caves, you will wake up
in the last safe cave you were in, but the monsters may have jacked some of
your hard earned loot!

You can find armor to help protect yourself, but you are still likely
to take a beating from all of the monsters you encounter.  Your armor
has a limited durability, and will eventually fail.

ITEMS:  Every piece of loot you find has a use!  You can use everything 
you find as a weapon, as armor, or to help heal yourself!
