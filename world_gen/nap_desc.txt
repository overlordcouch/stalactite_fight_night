You collapse to floor, exhausted.  Sleep overtakes you.
You settle your back against a wall, keeping guard while you rest.  
You find a comfy patch of rocks to take a nap on.
You sit down to rest, but sleep soon overtakes you.
You rest.
You rest your weary bones.
You take a little break.  You feel like you've earned it.
You sit in the caven and begin to drowse.
As you lean against the wall, tired beyond belief, you doze.
You dream that you are trapped in a cave full of monsters.  How unfortunate!
You get as comfortable as you can in a dark, despairing cavern.  You float off to dream land.
