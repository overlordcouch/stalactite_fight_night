An Adventurer is You!

GAMEPLAY:
In Stalactite Fight Night, you play a thrill-seeking adventurer
attempting to plumb the depths of the Caves of Neverending Despair
and Depth.  Armed with your bare hands and your trusty bathrobe, you
set off to prove your bravery in the caves!

You enter the caves and are provided with a description of your
surroundings.  You may encounter aggressive monsters that you need
to defend yourself against.  On the other hand, you may encounter 
hidden treasure chests containing a variety of helpful trash and loot.
Search caves to find less obvious loot!  Don't be discouraged if you
don't find anything.  Each time you search, you get a little better at
finding hidden loot!

If you are overcome by monsters while exploring the caves, you will wake up
in the last safe cave you were in, but the monsters may have jacked some of
your hard earned loot!

You can find armor to help protect yourself, but you are still likely
to take a beating from all of the monsters you encounter.  Your armor
has a limited durability, and will eventually fail.

ITEMS:  Every piece of loot you find has a use!  You can use everything 
you find as a weapon, as armor, or to help heal yourself! 

The top right corner of the screen will display your character's status:

			PlayerName (Player Level)
			[Health Bar!]
			Health Points/ Max Health
			Equipped Armor (Armor Level)
			Equipped Weapon (Weapon Level)


The options available for you to act upon are displayed in the lower
right-hand corner of the screen.  

******** Cave Actions:

		N: Take a nap.  Napping will allow you to regain some
				or all of your missing health.  Be careful,
				though!  You are in dangerous caverns, so
				monsters may wander in while you are napping.


		I:  Access your inventory.  Check out the loot/trash you have
					    collected.  For more details, see
					    inventor actions.

		O:  Open the chest.  If you see a chest in the cavern, open it!
				     They contain all sorts of useful items!

		S:  Search for loot. If you don't see a chest anywhere, or have already
         			     found the obvious one, search for more!  The more you
				     search, the better you get at searching!

		R/L/F:  Choose a direction to travel.  These are based on the paths you can
			see out of the current cave.


********Combat Actions:

		I:  Inventory.		Interact with your items!  You can't change your
					armor in battle, because that would leave you too
					exposed.  You can swap weapons or quickly heal 
					self, but this will use up your combat turn.
					See Inventory Actions for more detail on 
					inventory interaction.

		R:  Retreat.		Retreat from battle!  This game is meant to be challenging, 
					so retreat is nothing to be afraid of.  Be careful, though!  
					As you turn to run, the monster may get a chance to hit you!

		A:  Attack.		Defend yourself with whatever fanciful weapon you have equipped!


********Inventory Actions:

		#:  Choose an item.	Your inventory is numbered, allowing you to choose an item to interact 
					with.

		E:  Equip.		If the item is a weapon or armor, you can equip it!  Your currently
					equipped item will be returned to your inventory.

		U:  Use.		If the item can heal you, you can use it!

		D:  Discard.		Tired of low level stuff junking up your bag?  Discard it!
