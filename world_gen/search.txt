You peer into every corner.
You search every nook.
You turn over every stone.
You peak behind every boulder.
You comb the entire cavern.
You check each shadow.
You explore every lump.
You hunt for treasure.
You probe the shadows with your discerning gaze.
You probe the darkness for loot.
You scour the cavern floor for prizes.
You sift through the rubble for items.
You pry back several flat stones.
You rummage in the detritus.
You root around in the dirt.
